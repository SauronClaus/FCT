Pokemon
Blue Oak (Japanese: オーキド・グリーン Green Okido) is the rival of the player and the Champion in the Generation I games, as well as in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, their Generation III remakes. Sometime during the three years between the plotline of the Generation I games, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, and the events of the Generation II games and their remakes, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as well as during the events of Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, Blue takes the place of Giovanni as the Viridian City Gym Leader, as Giovanni had disappeared after he disbanded Team Rocket. Blue does not specialize in a particular type of Pokémon and, like Giovanni before him, he gives anyone who defeats him an Earth Badge.
