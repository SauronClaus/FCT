Bobby
Paper Mario
Bobby, or Bob-omb, was Mario's second ally in Paper Mario: The Origami King. He was introduced as an amnesiac Bob-omb with no fuse. His personality is very laid-back and he wishes to regain his past memories, as well as make new ones with Mario and Olivia, and help them remove the streamers King Olly has placed around the world. While he has no overworld abilities, in battle he can perform the Bomb Bump.
