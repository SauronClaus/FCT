Brown Stupid Rat Creature
Bone
In particular, two recurring Rat Creatures are focus antagonists in the series as they hunt for the "one with the star". While posing something of a threat in their repeated attempts to eat Bone (or "small mammal", as they call him), they are quite bumbling and idiotic in their behavior. In particular, one expresses a desire for quiche, only to be criticized by the other for not "acting like a beast". During the Roque Ja chapter, they become temporary allies of Bone and the others, but quickly betray them to return to Kingdok. By the end of the series, they return to the wild and are given a steaming hot quiche by Bone as a token of Winter Solstice good will.
