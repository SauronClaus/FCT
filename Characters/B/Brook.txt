Brook
One Piece
"Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of their two swordsmen. He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join, doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc. Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life after death once. Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control over his own soul and the souls of others. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.
