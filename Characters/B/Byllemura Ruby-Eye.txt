Byllemura Ruby-Eye
Band of Fools Original
Byllemura Ruby-Eye was a Rock Gnome Artificer that traveled with the Original Band of Fools, along with the rebooted version. He joined the party after he was the only survivor of a failed expedition to recover the Black Dragon Amulet, before being thrown into the conflict against the old gods. In the reboot, he was among those hired by Aelar Galanodel and Shabroth Nexoc to investigate their missing companions, Bindur Volgoth and Arthas Menethil, before he was thrust suddenly into a multiverse spanning adventure that ended with the death of Ao, the all-god.
