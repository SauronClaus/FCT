Baron Zemo
MCU
Baron Helmut Zemo is a former Colonel with the Sokovian Armed Forces and a commander of EKO Scorpion. Following the Battle of Sokovia, Zemo became a criminal mastermind who sought revenge against the Avengers after losing his family and became obsessed with destroying them. Knowing he was no match against the Avengers, Zemo had planned to have them destroy themselves, by framing the Winter Soldier for killing T'Chaka, which caused Captain America to defend Barnes from the world. That action had caused their Avengers Civil War, in which Iron Man led their manhunt for Barnes and Zemo allowed Stark to discover that Barnes was responsible for his parents' murder. With the Avengers now in ruins, Zemo tried to shoot himself but was captured by Black Panther and given to Joint Counter Terrorist Centre for his imprisonment.
