Bill Cipher
Gravity Falls
Bill Cipher was a triangular interdimensional demon, formerly existent only in the mindscape before succeeding in gaining access to the real world. He had been running amok in Gravity Falls, Oregon since being summoned by Stanford Pines over thirty years ago, and was also known for his mysterious demeanor and sadistic humor. Bill is the main antagonist of Gravity Falls, although he doesn't play a central role in the series until his first physical appearance in the penultimate Season 1 episode, "Dreamscaperers."
