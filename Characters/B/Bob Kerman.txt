Bob Kerman
Kerbal Space Program
Bob Kerman is kerbonaut #0003 and the least stupid of “the Original Four”. Appropriately, he is a scientist. Bob's position near the top of the list of kerbonauts in every game means players will be far more likely to have him on missions than any of the random kerbonauts; however, being third in the list of the original four makes him less frequently used than Jeb or Bill.
