Boba Fett
Star Wars Original Trilogy
Boba Fett (/ˌboʊbə ˈfɛt, ˌbɒ-/) is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. He is an armored bounty hunter featured in both the original and prequel film trilogies, but first appeared in the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), voiced by Don Francks. In the original trilogy, the character is a supporting antagonist and was mainly portrayed by Jeremy Bulloch and voiced by Jason Wingreen. Notable for his taciturn demeanor and for never removing his helmet, Fett appears in both The Empire Strikes Back (1980), employed by the Galactic Empire, and Return of the Jedi (1983), serving the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. While seemingly killed in Return of the Jedi after falling into a sarlacc, he has since appeared in Star Wars media set after the film, confirming his survival. Fett was retroactively added to the Special Edition of A New Hope released in 1997, making a non-speaking cameo appearance. A preteen Boba is portrayed by Daniel Logan in the prequel film Attack of the Clones (2002), which reveals the character's origins as the genetic clone and adoptive son of Jango Fett, also a famous bounty hunter.
