Buford Van Stomm
Phineas & Ferb
Buford Van Stomm is the anti-deuteragonist of Phineas and Ferb. He is a local bully with a high sense of rudeness, but is not exactly evil. In fact, Buford is a friend of the series' protagonists and other characters as well, aside from being rather soft and infantile sometimes. Throughout the series, he is paired with Baljeet.
