Bruno Madrigal
Encanto
Bruno Madrigal is the deuteragonist of Disney's 2021 animated feature film, Encanto. He is the only son of Alma Madrigal, with the gift to see into the future. Bruno's eccentric demeanor, affinity for rats, and often doomsaying visions had distinguished him as the "black sheep" of the Madrigals, resulting in his estrangement from the family.
