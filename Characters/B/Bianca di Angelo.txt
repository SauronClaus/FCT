Bianca di Angelo
Percy Jackson
Bianca di Angelo was a Greek demigod, a daughter of Hades and Maria di Angelo, and the older sister of Nico di Angelo. She became a Hunter of Artemis after being saved along with Percy Jackson, Grover Underwood, Thalia Grace, and her brother Nico by the Hunters. She later died (killed by one of Hephaestus' defective automatons, Talos) at the age of twelve and chose to be reborn after reaching Elysium.
