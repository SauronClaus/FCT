Bismuth
Steven Universe
Bismuth is one of the original and current members of the Crystal Gems. Before the end of the Rebellion, she and Rose Quartz had a conflict of interests, leading to them falling out. This ultimately led to Bismuth being poofed, bubbled, and left inside of the Pink Dimension. Rose then lied to the other Gems, telling them that she went missing in battle.
