Captain Nemo
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea
Captain Nemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he is later described as the son of an East Indian raja. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his submarine, the Nautilus, which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to a cover address and assembled in secrecy. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of imperialism; the British Empire is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist.
