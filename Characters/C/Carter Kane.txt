After the death of his mother at the age of eight, he spent the next six years traveling the globe with his father and living out of a suitcase.

When he was fourteen, Carter became aware of the House of Life and he and his sister brought back a long forbidden form of magic. Carter later becomes the Pharaoh of the House of Life and is one of the three most powerful magicians in the world, next to his Uncle Amos, and tied with his sister.
