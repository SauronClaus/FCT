Calypso
Percy Jackson
Calypso was a third generation Titaness, a daughter of Atlas. As punishment for her support in the First Titanomachy, she was banished to Ogygia, a remote island where different heroes whom she couldn't help but fall in love with would end up. None of those heroes whom she falls for would ever be able to stay with her. Calypso was rescued by Leo Valdez after the Second Giant War ended. Once she left her island, she gave up Titan-hood and is currently a mortal, but eventually regained her magical powers. Calypso is the girlfriend of Leo Valdez.
