Chara
Undertale
Chara (/ˈkærə/ KARR-ə[note 1]), also known as the fallen human, is the first human to fall into the Underground. Chara's name varies from game to game, as they carry the name that the player enters at the start of their playthrough, although Chara is noted to be the "true name". They are distinct from the controllable character played throughout the entirety of Undertale, who is the eighth fallen human.
