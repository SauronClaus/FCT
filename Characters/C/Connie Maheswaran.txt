Connie Maheswaran
Steven Universe
Connie Maheswaran is Steven Universe's best friend-turned-girlfriend and a member of the Crystal Gems who debuted in the episode "Bubble Buddies". After meeting Steven, she slowly began to learn about him, the Gems, and their past. Growing a strong bond with them, Connie decided that she wanted to help him and the Crystal Gems whenever danger arose in the Earth, training how to fight using a sword with Pearl since "Sworn to the Sword". She eventually becomes a skilled combatant and often aids the Gems during times of conflict.
