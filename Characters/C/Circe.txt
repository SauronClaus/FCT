Circe
Odyssey
Circe (/ˈsɜːrsiː/; Ancient Greek: Κίρκη, pronounced [kírkɛː]) is an enchantress and a minor goddess in Greek mythology. She is either a daughter of the god Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse or the goddess Hecate and Aeëtes. Circe was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs. Through the use of these and a magic wand or staff, she would transform her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals.
