Cara Dune
The Mandalorian
Cara Dune is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, appearing in the Disney+ television series The Mandalorian. She was portrayed in the show's first two seasons by actress and former mixed martial artist Gina Carano. The character is a former Rebel shock trooper who became a mercenary after the Galactic Civil War, and is later employed as a marshal of the New Republic. A highly trained and battle-hardened special forces warrior, Cara is skilled in the use of weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and battle tactics, and has an intense hatred of the Galactic Empire for its destruction of her homeworld, Alderaan. Carano described Cara as a loner who is having trouble readjusting to society following her career as a soldier.
