Luke Castellan
Percy Jackson
Luke Castellan was a Greek demigod, the son of Hermes and May Castellan. He was one of the main antagonists of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. He was the head counselor at Hermes' Cabin. Although he allowed the Titan Lord Kronos to take possession of his body, Luke died as the hero of the Great Prophecy. Before dying, Luke stated an intention to go through rebirth rather than go to Elysium despite his hero's death, hoping to eventually reach the Isles of the Blest.
