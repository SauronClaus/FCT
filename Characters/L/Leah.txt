Leah
Stardew Valley
Leah is a villager who lives in a small cottage outside Pelican Town. She's one of the twelve characters available to marry. She spends each morning sculpting inside her cottage. Her home opens at 10:00 AM, but players must first acquire two hearts in friendship before being allowed inside. The first time the player enters her cottage an event will be triggered, but only if she is at home at the time.
