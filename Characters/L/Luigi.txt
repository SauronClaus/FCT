Luigi (Japanese: ルイージ, Hepburn: Ruīji, pronounced [ɾɯ.iːʑi]; English: /luˈiːdʒi/ loo-EE-jee, Italian: [luˈiːdʒi]) is a fictional character featured in video games and related media released by Nintendo. Created by designer Shigeru Miyamoto, Luigi is portrayed as the younger fraternal twin brother of Nintendo's mascot Mario. Luigi appears in many games throughout the Mario franchise, often as a sidekick to his older twin brother. Luigi first appeared in the 1983 Game & Watch game Mario Bros. as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in the Mario Bros. arcade game, Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was Super Mario Bros. 2. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the Mario Party and Mario Kart series, though he has been featured in a starring role on seven occasions: first in the 1990 LCD wrist watch game Luigi's Hammer Toss, in Mario is Missing, in Luigi's Mansion for the GameCube in 2001, in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, in Dr. Luigi and New Super Luigi U for the Wii U in 2013, in Luigi's Mansion Arcade in 2015 for arcades and Luigi's Mansion 3 for Nintendo Switch in 2019. In all seven of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because usually Mario, the titular hero of the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three DiC TV series based on the NES and Super NES games.
