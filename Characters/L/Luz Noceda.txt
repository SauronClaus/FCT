Luz Noceda
The Owl House
Luz Noceda is the protagonist of The Owl House. She is an eager, teenage Latina human who accidentally stumbled upon a portal to the Boiling Isles in the Demon Realm, a dimension where magical creatures are real, and humans are despised and treated as lesser beings. In order to prove herself as a witch, Luz begins learning magic under Eda's guidance, despite not having magical abilities of her own.
