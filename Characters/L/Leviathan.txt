Leviathan
Worm
Leviathan (pronounced: "leh-VY-uh-than") is one of the Endbringers. He is the second of the Endbringers to appear and is considered the "middle child" between Behemoth and the Simurgh. Despite not possessing the sheer power of Behemoth or the intellect of the Simurgh, he shares strengths with both of them, making him a dangerous threat that can be unexpectedly cunning.
