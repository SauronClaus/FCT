Yondu Udonta
MCU
Yondu Udonta was the Centaurian leader of an exiled faction of the Ravagers and the adoptive father of Peter Quill. When Quill betrayed the Ravagers and stole the Orb for himself, Udonta led the hunt for his former ally. Eventually, Udonta caught up with Quill, but he was convinced to help him in the battle against Ronan the Accuser, who was threatening to use the Power Stone to destroy Xandar, with Quill ensuring Udonta did not get the Infinity Stone at the end. Despite losing the stone, Udonta chose not to get revenge against Quill, leading to mistrust among all of his own clan.
