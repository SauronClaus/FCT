Eldon "Spark" Turen
Band of Fools Reboot
Eldon "Spark" Turen was a male half-gnome battlesmith that traveled with the rebooted Band of Fools. He joined the group first on their quest from Aelar Galanodel before joining the group on their travels through first Faerun and later Eberron, before finally being present with the rest of the Band before the death of Ao and their subsquent transfer to the Last Resort.
