Ego
MCU
Ego was a Celestial, a primordial and powerful being, and the biological father of Peter Quill. A living planet with a humanoid extension of himself, Ego sought to find meaning in his life and, to achieve this end, planned to remake the entire universe via an omnicidal extinction-level event known as the Expansion, using "seeds" planted on various worlds to terraform them into new extensions of himself, thereby eradicating all other life in the universe but himself.
