Emperor Belos
The Owl House
Hunter, formerly known as the Golden Guard, is a major character of The Owl House, depicted originally as an antagonist. He was the right-hand man of Emperor Belos and the former head of the Emperor's Coven. Hunter was presumed to be the nephew of Belos and as such, he was dedicated to his cause of ending all wild magic in the realm, but in reality, he is the latest version of the Golden Guard clones created by Belos to serve him faithfully in his mad quest.
