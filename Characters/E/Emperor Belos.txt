Emperor Belos
The Owl House
Emperor Belos is the main antagonist of The Owl House. Originally a human named Philip Wittebane, he arrived in the Boiling Isles from Gravesfield, Connecticut during the Deadwardian Era (the mid-1600s in the Human Realm) in pursuit of his brother, Caleb, who was spirited away to the realm, keeping a written record of his experiences on the Boiling Isles as he endeavored to find a way to return to the Human Realm. Due to his inherent intense hatred of witches and magic, with which he gained additional resentment due to the Isles' prejudice against humans causing him to be alienated, Philip would eventually conspire to eliminate the Isles and its inhabitants as a whole in an attempt to save humanity from their supposed wickedness.
