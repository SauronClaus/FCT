Extortionist Hobo
Door Monster
The Extortionist Hobo is perhaps the most beloved character in all of Door Monster. His gruff voice, puppet friends, perpetual lack of money, and overabundance of ideas for gaining cash with the least possible effort has endeared him to many fans. His typical appearance consists of a dark blue coat, a bowler hat, a curly black beard, and a backpack full of sellable items. He appears quite attached to LeBron, as he follows him around and affectionately calls him "Fridge Guy".
