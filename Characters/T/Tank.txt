Tank
The Matrix
Tank was the operator onboard the Nebuchadnezzar. He was born naturally in Zion, brother to Dozer and Zee, and died young, sometime between his final appearance in The Matrix and the start of The Matrix Reloaded, of unspecified causes. He is succeeded in his shipboard duties by Link. Tank is played by Marcus Chong. Tank's muscular body makes him feel like he's tough as a tank, hence the reason he named himself Tank.
