Thalia Grace
Percy Jackson
Thalia Grace is a Greek demigod, the daughter of Zeus and the mortal Beryl Grace, and the older sister of Roman demigod Jason Grace. She was transformed into a pine tree on Half-Blood Hill, which still stands as the official border for Camp Half-Blood to this day after being mortally wounded by attacking monsters. She is later resurrected by the Golden Fleece under the manipulations of Kronos in an attempt to control the Great Prophecy. She is currently the lieutenant of the Hunters of Artemis, leading them in the absence of the goddess after accepting Artemis' offer following a failed attempt by Kronos to use Thalia to destroy the gods.
