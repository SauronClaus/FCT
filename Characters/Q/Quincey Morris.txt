Quincey Morris
Dracula
Quincey P. Morris is a fictional character in Bram Stoker's 1897 horror novel Dracula. He is a rich young American from Texas, and one of the three men who propose to Lucy Westenra. Quincey is friends with her other two suitors, Arthur Holmwood and Dr. John Seward, even after Lucy has chosen Arthur, as well as Jonathan Harker who is to be married to Lucy's best friend Mina Harker. He carries a Bowie knife at all times, and at one point he admits that he is a teller of tall tales and 'a rough fellow, who hasn't perhaps lived as a man should' (Dracula Chapter 25). Quincey is the last person to donate his blood to Lucy before her death. Aside from Dracula, Quincey is the only major character not to keep some form of journal.
