Druig
MCU
Druig is a member of the genetically-engineered Eternals, which came to Earth around 5000 BC. He possesses the ability to control minds. Despite developing a close relationship with fellow Eternal Makkari, he grew disillusioned with their mission and chose to leave the Eternals, forming a society of mind-controlled humans. Living in a self imposed exile for centuries, Druig led his secret society, keeping them safe from what he saw as the horrors of the outside world.
