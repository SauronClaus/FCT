Dune: Part One
Leto I Atreides (/ˈleɪtoʊ əˈtreɪɪdiːz/) is the Duke of House Atreides, and father to Paul Atreides. He is introduced in Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, and is later a primary character in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. According to Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House Atreus.
