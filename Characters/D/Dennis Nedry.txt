Dennis Nedry
Jurassic Park
Dennis Nedry is one of the main human antagonists in the novel and film. In the novel, he is described as an obese and messy computer scientist. Nedry works for Hammond as the system's programmer and is in charge of networking Jurassic Park's computers. Although he was not given any details about InGen's operation, Nedry was expected to fix numerous bugs and issues without understanding the ultimate goal. After InGen blackmails him to make changes to the system without further payment, he makes a deal with Dodgson of Biosyn to steal embryos of the park's 15 dinosaur species. He is promised $50,000 for each species he delivers, and an additional $50,000 for each embryo that proves viable, for a maximum payment of $1.5 million. Dodgson provides Nedry with an embryo carrier/cooler disguised as a can of shaving cream. In order to carry out the theft, he shuts down the park's security systems, including several electric fences surrounding select dinosaur paddocks. He plans to steal embryos from a secure lab, drive across the park to hand them off to a Biosyn agent waiting at the dock, then return to the control room and reactivate the security systems before his absence becomes suspicious. On his way to deliver the embryos, a tropical storm causes him to miss crucial road signs, and he becomes lost in the jungle and is subsequently blinded and killed by a venomous Dilophosaurus. In the novel, his body is later found by Muldoon and Gennaro. Nedry's intricate, complex computer knowledge makes him vain and prideful although later, one of Hammond's grandchildren is able to navigate Nedry's system and restore power to the Visitor Center.
