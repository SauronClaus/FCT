Dick Grayson
DC Comics
Richard John "Dick" Grayson is a fictional character and superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, he first appeared in Detective Comics #38 in April 1940 as the original and most popular incarnation of Robin, partner to the superhero Batman forming the iconic Dynamic Duo team. In Tales of the Teen Titans #44 (July 1984) the character, after becoming a young adult and in an effort to make himself a separate independent hero from Batman, retires his role as Robin and assumes the superhero persona of Nightwing (created by Marv Wolfman and artist George PÃ©rez).
