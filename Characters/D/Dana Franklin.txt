Dana Franklin
Kindred
The protagonist and narrator of the novel, Dana is a black woman from 1979 California who gets pulled back in time to Antebellum Maryland to save the life of her white ancestor, Rufus Weylin. Dana is a strong, resourceful, intelligent woman, as well as a writer like her white husband Kevin. Dana learns how to adapt to the oppression of the Antebellum (pre-Civil War) era, but always retains her sense of self and autonomy despite Rufusâ€™s attempts to force her to become a true slave. Dana struggles between the relationships she has built with fellow slaves on the Weylin plantation, such as Sarah and Nigel, her sisterhood with the enslaved Alice, and her blood tie to Rufus as she tries to survive in the past with as little damage as possible to herself and others. As Butler deals with issues of freedom and privilege, she displays in the bonds between Dana and Rufus the delicate balance between master and slave and in Dana and Kevin the eventual possibilities of truly beneficial interracial relationship. Dana loses her left arm after her final trip to the past, bearing a physical reminder of the burden that many descendants of slaves bear from this family history.
