Wallace West
DC Comics
Wallace West is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Originally introduced as a new interpretation of Wally West, as part of DC's The New 52 relaunch, the comic DC Rebirth #1 later established that he is, in fact, a new character of the same name, being Wally's cousin, both named after their great-grandfather. To avoid confusion, the character was renamed in later comics as Wallace West.
