Wendy Corduroy
Gravity Falls
Wendy Blerble Corduroy (born ca. 1997) is a tall, laid-back teenager working a part-time job at the Mystery Shack. Fun-loving and rebellious, she frequently shirks responsibility for activities she finds more enjoyable, such as hanging out with her rambunctious friends or going on adventures with Dipper and Mabel Pines. Wendy represents the ice pack on the Zodiac, due to her cool demeanor in the face of danger.
