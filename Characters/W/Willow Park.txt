Willow Park
The Owl House
Willow Park is a major supporting character of The Owl House. She is friends with Luz, Amity, and Gus and attends the same magic school as them. She was formerly part of the abomination track, but is now on the plant track. Willow is naturally very gifted at plant magic, but since she was forced into the abomination track, many characters assumed she was incompetent.
