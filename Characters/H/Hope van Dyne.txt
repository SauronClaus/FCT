Hope van Dyne
Marvel Comics
Hope van Dyne is a character portrayed by Evangeline Lilly in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, loosely based on the Marvel Comics character Hope Pym. Portrayed as the daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, she was a senior board member of her father's company, Pym Technologies, and later inherits the superhero identity of Wasp from her mother, using a suit containing shrinking technology to shrink to the size of an insect and also fly with insect-themed wings. She first appeared in the 2015 film Ant-Man. Lilly went on to appear in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). She has been noted for being the first superheroine to be a titular character in an MCU film, preceding Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel and Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow.
