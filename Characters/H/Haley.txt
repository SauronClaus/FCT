Haley
Stardew Valley
Haley is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. She's one of the twelve characters available to marry. “Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a tendency to judge people for superficial reasons. But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?”
