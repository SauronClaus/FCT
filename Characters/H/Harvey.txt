Harvey
Stardew Valley
Harvey is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. He runs the town's medical clinic and is passionate about the health of the townsfolk. He's one of the twelve characters available to marry. “Harvey is the town doctor. He’s a little old for a bachelor, but he has a kind heart and a respected position in the community. He lives in a small apartment above the medical clinic, but spends most of his time working. You can sense a sadness about him, as if there’s something he’s not telling you…”
