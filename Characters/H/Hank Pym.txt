Hank Pym
Marvel Comics
Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by penciler Jack Kirby, editor-plotter Stan Lee and scripter Larry Lieber, the character first appeared in Tales to Astonish #27 (January 1962). The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone science-fiction anthology story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the superhero Ant-Man with the power to shrink to the size of an insect. Alongside his crime-fighting partner-wife Janet van Dyne, he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing Giant-Man and Goliath; the insect-themed Yellowjacket; and briefly the Wasp. He is a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and the creator of the robotic villain Ultron.
