Kazooie
Banjo & Kazooie
Kazooie is one of the two main protagonists in the Banjo-Kazooie series. She is a red-crested breegull who lives in her pal Banjo's backpack most of the time, poking her head out only to berate various other characters with insults and jabbering. She does leave the backpack on occasion, but her friendship with Banjo always leads her back eventually.
