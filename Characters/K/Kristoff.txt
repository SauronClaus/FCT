Kristoff
Frozen
Kristoff Bjorgman is the tritagonist of Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen and a major character in its 2019 sequel. He is a Sami outdoorsman that worked as an ice harvester with his reindeer Sven. Having been an orphan who was raised by a colony of trolls in the mountains, Kristoff was initially wary of humans, believing them to be untrustworthy, cheating crooks. His outlook would slowly change upon meeting Princess Anna, whose warmheartedness would prove that people aren't as bad as Kristoff believed.
