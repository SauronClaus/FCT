Kratos
God of War
Kratos (Greek: Κράτος) is the playable protagonist of the God of War series. Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and a Spartan General, up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them, albeit by accident, under Ares' command, earning him the nickname of "The Ghost of Sparta", after which he renounced his service to the War God, eventually killing him and ascending to Godhood before exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him.
