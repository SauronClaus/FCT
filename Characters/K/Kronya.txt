Kronya
Fire Emblem: Three Houses
Kronya is an antagonist from Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Kronya appears as a cheerful young woman whose childish disposition belies her underlying brutality. She is sadistic and cruel, enjoying inflicting pain onto others such as stabbing Jeralt with a smile on her face. During her fight, she looks down upon those she believes inferior to her and refers to enemies as "Vermin" throughout her fight. She shows surprise when Solon turns on her and is not above pleading for her life, as her final words were asking Byleth to save her despite being enemies.
