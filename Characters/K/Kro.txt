Kro
MCU
Kro was the leader of the Deviants. Kro came to Earth thousands of years ago, but was trapped in ice for millennia, while the rest of his kind were exterminated by the Eternals. Due to glacial melting as a side effect of the impeding Emergence of Tiamut the Communicator, he and an isolated legion of Deviants were set free. Kro killed Ajak, gaining her powers of regeneration, and began hunting down the Eternals in a quest for power. After killing Gilgamesh during the Ambush at Druig's Compound in the Peruvian Amazonia, Kro gained a sentience never before experienced by a Deviant. Kro came to realize how both Eternals and Deviants were being used, motivating him further to kill all Eternals. He followed them as they tried to stop the Emergence, but was ultimately killed by Thena after failing to absorb her powers.
