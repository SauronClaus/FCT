Kingo
MCU
Kingo is a cosmic-powered member of the community of genetically-engineered Eternals. Created by the Celestials in the World Forge, Kingo was sent to Earth in 5000 BC to progress the planet's societal development. Kingo was a warrior in the group who proved a useful asset in their fight against the Deviants. After the Eternals parted ways in 1521, Kingo grew more attached to humankind, and settled in India to become a famous Bollywood movie star, dancer and director, known professionally as Raj Kingo Deva (Hindi: राज किंगो देवा).
