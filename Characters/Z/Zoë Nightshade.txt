Zoë Nightshade
Percy Jackson
Zoë Nightshade, daughter of Atlas and Pleione, was a former Hesperide; nymph of the sunset, who was later exiled and blotted out as if she never existed. For this reason, she joined the Hunters of Artemis, becoming the loyal lieutenant of Artemis for over 2000 years. She now resides in the stars, as she has shown a great interest and connection to the stars. Her constellation "The Huntress" is depicted as girl who is running around shooting arrows in the night sky.
