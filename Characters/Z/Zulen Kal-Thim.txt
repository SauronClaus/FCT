Zulen Kal-Thim
Unbroken
Zulen Kal-Thim was a male eladrin monk (Way of the Long Death) and assassin. In the year 12034, he was transported into the other world, losing his memories in the process and developing an entirely new personality named Reithen Keiros. After he regained his memories, this discrepancy caused him to develop a split personality that took the form and personality of the original Zulen Kal-Thim.
