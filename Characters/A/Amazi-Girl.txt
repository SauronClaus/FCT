Amazi-Girl
Shortpacked
Amber is uneasy when dealing with people, so Cheese only knows why she runs the customer service desk. It probably has to do with how she feels more secure behind the counter, with a solid barrier between herself and real li-- er, customers. She has an Internet boyfriend. She isn't very good at eye contact. She is also secretly evil.
