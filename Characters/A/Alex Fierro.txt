Alex Fierro
Magnus Chase
Alex Fierro is a genderfluid, formerly homeless teenager from Boston, Massachusetts. Alex is the Norse demigod child of the god Loki (in a female form) and Mr. Fierro, a mortal businessman. Due to Alexâ€˜s gender identity and being the child of a Norse deity, they were constantly berated, harassed, and assaulted by others and eventually disowned by her family. After dying and being chosen to become an einherji by their half-sister, Samirah al-Abbas, Alex is now the newest named resident of the Hotel Valhalla and a hallmate to Magnus Chase and the other occupants of their section of Floor Nineteen. Alex is currently the significant other of Magnus Chase.
