Dr. Allison Blake
Eureka
Allison Carter (n√©e Blake) was a Department of Defense agent working as a government liaison between Eureka and the Pentagon. In the episode "Invincible", it was revealed that she was once a medical doctor and has 2 PhDs (Season 3, Episode 3 Best in Faux ). She oversees the main laboratories of Eureka, and is always present when anything goes wrong. She always has some sort of trouble to bring to Jack Carter, be it professional or otherwise. Since she is responsible for reporting on the progress of Eureka's citizens, as well as their temperamental innovations, she is always at the forefront of any dilemma that might arise. She was Director of Operations for Global Dynamics after Nathan Stark.
