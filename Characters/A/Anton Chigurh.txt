Anton Chigurh
No Country for Old Men
Anton Chigurh is a hitman who is devoid of conscience, remorse, and compassion. He is described by Carson Wells, a central character in the novel, as a "psychopathic killer", in his 30s, with a dark complexion, and eyes as "blue as lapis ... Like wet stones." His signature weapon is a captive bolt stunner, which he uses to kill his victims and also as a tool to shoot out door locks. He also wields a sound-suppressed Remington 11-87 semiautomatic shotgun and pistol (as well as a TEC-9 in the film adaptation). This particular shotgun was only introduced in 1987 despite the film taking place in 1980. Throughout both the novel and the film, Chigurh flips a coin to decide the fate of some of his victims.
