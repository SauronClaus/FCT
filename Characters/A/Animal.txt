Animal
The Muppets
Animal is the wild drummer on The Muppet Show, performing with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem. A crazed percussionist with three styles of music — loud, louder, and deafening — Animal speaks in a guttural shout, often repeating a few simple phrases, such as "BEAT DRUMS! BEAT DRUMS!" or "WO-MAN!" In relatively calmer moods, he is capable of more coherent conversation, though these instances are infrequent.
