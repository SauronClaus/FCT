Amilyn Holdo
Star Wars Sequel Trilogy
Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. She is introduced in the 2017 Claudia Gray novel Star Wars: Leia, Princess of Alderaan as the childhood best friend of Princess Leia Organa. Holdo and Leia first meet as teenagers when they are both enrolled in Coruscant's Apprentice Legislature, with Holdo subsequently becoming an important member of the Rebel Alliance. Holdo reappears in the 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi, in which she is portrayed by Laura Dern as a member of Organa's Resistance, as well as a number of Star Wars comics. Claudia Gray's version of the character has received high acclaim from critics and fans alike, with many comparing her to the character of Luna Lovegood from the Harry Potter series. Rian Johnson's version in The Last Jedi has received generally negative reception, but Laura Dern's performance as an older Holdo has received praise; however, some have criticized her characterization for being too different from her younger book counterpart.
