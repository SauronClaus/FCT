Amara
Borderlands 3
A crimefighting hero born in the abysmal slums of Partali, Amara is most at home on the battlefield or in a brawl. She quickly became a local hero when she was young, once showing off by punching holes in a concrete truck. Never content to stand idly by, people celebrated when she used her Siren abilities the first time she fought a bully, and since then, she's been using her powers to smash oppressors and dismantle her foes. While in her Phasetrance, she channels her Siren energy to form powerful arms that can shoot blasts of force or crush enemies in their grip. Brash, aggressive, and self-assured, Amara doesn't let anything stand in her way, though has been torn between seeking justice and building her personal legend since her early vigilante days.
