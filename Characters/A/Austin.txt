Austin
The Backyardigans
Austin is a purple kangaroo and a major character in The Backyardigans. Austin is described as the "new kangaroo on the block," and he does not know the other characters very well yet. He is somewhat hesitant to express his opinions, and slow to take the lead. When he overcomes his shy feelings, Austin gets the respect he deserves. He is revealed to be sweet and intelligent as the series progresses. Throughout his adventures, he frequently takes the role of a humble servant or faithful assistant, putting his friends' needs ahead of his own and helping them in any way he can. He is not one to ask for recognition, but even so, he receives a lot of love and support from his friends for all that he does for them.
