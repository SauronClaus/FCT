Arthail, Consumer of Food
Band of Fools Original
Arthail, Consumer of Food, was a male Dragonborn Barbarian/Paladin in the Original Band of Fools campaign and the reboot. As a member of the original trio, he was hired by Gundren Rockseeker to transport a wagon to Phandelver, before being embroiled in the conflict between the old gods and the current gods. In the reboot, he was among those hired by Aelar Galanodel and Shabroth Nexoc to investigate their missing companions, Bindur Volgoth and Arthas Menethil, before he was thrust suddenly into a multiverse spanning adventure that ended with the death of Ao, the all-god.
