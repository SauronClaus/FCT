Shane
Stardew Valley
Shane is a villager in Pelican Town who is often rude and unhappy, and suffers from depression and alcohol dependence. However, his attitude starts to change towards any player who chooses to befriend him. He works at JojaMart most days between 9am and 5pm, and after work he frequently spends his evenings in The Stardrop Saloon. He doesn't work on the weekend except on rainy days, and is frequently around the ranch. In the Social Status menu, Shane's outfit will change to a Joja Corporation uniform when he is at his job at JojaMart. He's one of the twelve characters available to marry.
