Sam Samms
Sam and Fuzzy
Sam is an idealistic young man living in the fictional city of Newport. Sam moved to Newport to attend college, but lost his conditional scholarship and had to drop out, after which point he met and befriended Fuzzy. Sam has had multiple jobs, including a driver for X-per-S Taxi, a bookseller at Bunton's Books, and a roadie for Noosehead. After his accidental involvement in the murder of the Ninja Mafia's emperor, Sam went on the run, but later learned that he was now the syndicate's rightful emperor. After taking power, Sam reorganized the Ninja Mafia into NMS (Ninja Mafia Services), an organization to help people with supernatural or otherwise unusual problems. After failing to enact positive change with NMS, Sam reformed the Ninja Mafia and embraced the necessity of crime to fund his goals of changing the world for the better. He has also taken the Ninja Mafia Emperor's seat on the Underground Committee, a group that secretly controls the underground and the rest of the world in general. Sam's hair and facial design is similar to Sonic the Hedgehog, of whom Sam Logan is a self-confessed fan.
