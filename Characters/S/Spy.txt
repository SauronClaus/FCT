Spy
Team Fortress 2
Hailing from an indeterminate region of France, the Spy is an enthusiast of sharp suits and even sharper knives. He is a puzzle, wrapped in an enigma, shrouded in riddles, lovingly sprinkled with intrigue, express mailed to Mystery, Alaska, and LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU! but it is too late. You're dead. For he is the Spy - globetrotting rogue, lady killer (metaphorically) and mankiller (for real).
