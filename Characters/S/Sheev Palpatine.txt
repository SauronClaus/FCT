Emperor Palpatine
Star Wars Original Trilogy
Sheev Palpatine is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. Initially credited as The Emperor in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back, Palpatine is also known by his Sith title Darth Sidious. The character appears in each trilogy in the nine-film Skywalker saga, in which he is portrayed by Ian McDiarmid and serves as the overarching villain. In the original trilogy, Palpatine is depicted as emperor of the Galactic Empire and the master of Darth Vader. In the prequel trilogy, he is portrayed as a charismatic politician and Sith Lord who transforms the Galactic Republic into the Empire, and turns Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the final film in the sequel trilogy, Palpatine is revealed to be the mastermind behind the First Order and its former leader, Snoke, as well as the grandfather of protagonist Rey.
