Syndrome
The Incredibles
Syndrome (real name Buddy Pine) is the main antagonist of the 2004 Disneyâ€¢Pixar animated film The Incredibles. He originally wanted to be a sidekick to his then-idol Mr. Incredible, but when the superhero coldly rejected his offer, Syndrome went insane. To take revenge on Mr. Incredible, he became a supervillain and devoted his life to murdering all superheroes, besides selling his weapons to everyone in order to create a world in which everyone would be "super", so nobody would be unique.
