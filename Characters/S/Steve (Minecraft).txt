Steve
Minecraft
The player is the main character who can be controlled in Minecraft. The two default player skins are known as Steve (a name suggested by Notch as a joke but later confirmed in the "change skin" menu on minecraft.net, in-game as the default name in Bedrock Edition, and his name in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate) and Alex, with all unchanged skins being split between the two default skins.
