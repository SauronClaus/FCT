Squee
Band of Fools Redux
Squee was a male Goblin Chronology Wizard that briefly traveled with the Band of Fools during the Reboot. He met with the party at Cornelius's shipyard after the untimely death of Jori-En Blurred as their replacement interdimensional bureaucrat, and joined them for the remainer of their time adventuring through Eberron.
