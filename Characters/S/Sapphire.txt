Sapphire is a member of the Crystal Gems who made her official debut in "Jail Break". Previously a member of Blue Diamond's court, her mission was to inform her Diamond about the Rebels' attack using her future vision. After one of her guards, Ruby, accidentally fused with her, Sapphire fled with her to prevent her from being shattered by Blue Diamond. Sapphire later joined the Crystal Gems and remains together with Ruby as their fusion, Garnet.
