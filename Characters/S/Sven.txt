Sven
Frozen
Sven is a major character in Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen and its 2019 sequel. He is Kristoff's reindeer and best friend. Being a deer, Sven does not talk, and instead communicates through grunt-like vocals. However, Kristoff occasionally voices Sven's thoughts using a goofy "reindeer voice".
