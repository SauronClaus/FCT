Ikaris
MCU
Ikaris was the former tactical leader of the community of genetically-engineered Eternals. Created by the Celestials in the World Forge, Ikaris and his fellow Eternals were sent to Earth in 5000 BC to progress the planet's societal development and protect it from the Deviants. Ikaris learned early on of his true purpose to help initiate the Emergence for the birth of Tiamut the Communicator, believing Earth and humanity to be a necessary sacrifice for more life to be created in new galaxies. While on his mission, he grew a close relationship with fellow Eternal Sersi and eventually married her.
