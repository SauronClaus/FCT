IKCFAMWSIIF
Unbroken
IKCFAMWSIIF was a male warforged barbarian (Path of the Totem Warrior) and one of four scarred that arrived in Unbroken in 12034. He was present at the explosion that killed Lorana Ritten and merged Yekkon Shmalakis into Yekkosiris in 12065 and lost most of his limbs in the process, but they were soon replaced.
