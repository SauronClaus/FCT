Izuku Midoriya
My Hero Academia
Izuku Midoriya (緑谷出久 Midoriya Izuku?), also known as Deku (デク Deku?), is the main protagonist of the My Hero Academia manga and anime series. Even though Izuku was born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might due to his innate heroism and a strong sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil, as well as a former student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth holder of One For All.
