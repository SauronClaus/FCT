Medic
Team Fortress 2
The Medic is a Teutonic man of medicine from Stuttgart, Germany. While he may have a tenuous adherence to medical ethics, he is nonetheless the primary healing class of the team. Although the Medic's Syringe Gun and Bonesaw aren't the most excellent weapons for direct combat, he can typically still be found near the front lines, healing wounded teammates while trying to stay out of enemy fire.
