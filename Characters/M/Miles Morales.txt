Miles Morales
Marvel Comics
Miles Gonzalo Morales (/məˈræləs/) is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher Marvel Comics, and is one of the characters known as Spider-Man. The character was created in 2011 by writer Brian Michael Bendis and Italian artist Sara Pichelli, with input by Marvel's then-editor-in-chief Axel Alonso. Miles Morales first appeared in Ultimate Fallout #4 (Aug. 2011), following the death of Peter Parker. The 13-year-old biracial teenage son of a Black American father and a Puerto Rican mother, he is the second Spider-Man to appear in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint with a separate continuity from the mainstream Marvel Universe. He was featured in the Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man comic book series, and after Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015, Miles was made a character in the main Marvel Universe, beginning with stories under the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding that debuted that same year. The character was not the lead character in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated TV series on Disney XD but he was later added to the main cast, and the main protagonist in the 2018 feature film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.
