Valentina Kerman
Kerbal Space Program
Valentina Kerman is the first official female kerbal and the first new kerbal on the initial roster after the original three. She is a pilot and has the "badass" flag. In common with other female kerbals (aka Kerbalinas), she has a smaller head than the men, wears a bun and has eyelashes. She can be seen floating in front of Kerbin on the Start Game menu (identified by the 1.0 readme file).
