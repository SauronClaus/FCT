Vulture
MCU
Adrian Toomes is the owner of the Bestman Salvage, based inside New York City, who chose to become a criminal after he lost his entire livelihood once Damage Control, a joint venture between the federal government and Tony Stark, was created. Recruiting his co-workers and equipping himself with a flying exo-suit created from the Chitauri technology he had stolen, Toomes took on the identity of Vulture and then spent the next four years stealing the advanced weaponry to sell on their black market with the Shocker and Tinkerer. However, as Toomes' illegal activities were noticed by Spider-Man, Toomes was forced into tracking down the young hero. During the final clash, Spider-Man defeated Vulture before saving his life, and in gratitude, Toomes had refused to give up Spider-Man's true identity to all his inmates, including Mac Gargan, in prison.
