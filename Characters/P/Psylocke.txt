Psylocke
Marvel Comics
Elizabeth "Betsy" Braddock is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with Captain Britain and the X-Men. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Herb Trimpe in 1976, she first appeared in the Marvel UK series Captain Britain. Betsy Braddock was initially a supporting character in the adventures of her twin brother, Brian Braddock, as the original Captain Britain, before becoming the superheroine Captain Britain herself (and X-Men member Psylocke) in 1986. Originally presented as a precognitive in the pages of Captain Britain and then as a telepath, the character eventually had her mind placed in the body of the Japanese female ninja Kwannon, gaining many of Kwannon's martial arts skills and elements of her personality, as Lady Mandarin. Betsy's codename, coined by the villains Mojo and Spiral, debuted during her introduction to the X-Men stories post–Captain Britain.[2] Later, Betsy acquired the power of telekinesis. After finally regaining her own body and relinquishing the Psylocke identity to Kwannon, Betsy permanently took up the mantle of Captain Britain in 2019.
