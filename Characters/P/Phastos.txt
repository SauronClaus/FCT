Phastos
MCU
Phastos is the inventor of the community of genetically-engineered Eternals. Created by the Celestials in the World Forge, Phastos was sent to Earth in 5000 BC to progress the planet's societal development, and protect it from the Deviants. Phastos guided and progressed many technological innovations throughout the course of human history, but fell into a state of dejection after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, which resulted in monumental loss of human life. Blaming himself, he grew distant from his fellow Eternals and abandoned helping humankind.
