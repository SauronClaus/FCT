Paul Atreides
Dune: Part One
Paul Atreides (/əˈtreɪɪdiːz/; later known as Paul Muad'Dib) is a fictional character in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Paul is the primary protagonist in the first two novels in the series, Dune (1965) and Dune Messiah (1969), and returns in Children of Dune (1976). The character is brought back as two different gholas in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson novels which conclude the original series, Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), and appears in the prequels Paul of Dune (2008) and The Winds of Dune (2009). According to Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House Atreus.
