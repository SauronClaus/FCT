Princess Daisy
Mario
Princess Daisy (Japanese: デイジー姫, Hepburn: Deijī-hime, pronounced [deːʑiː çime]) is a fictional character in the Mario series of video games. She debuted in 1989's Super Mario Land as the ruler of Sarasaland. Described as a tomboy, she is rumored in-universe to be Luigi's love interest. This became the plot of the 1993 live-action film Super Mario Bros., in which Luigi saves Daisy from King Koopa. Waluigi has an unrequited crush on her.
