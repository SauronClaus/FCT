Peridot
Steven Universe
Peridot (specifically Peridot Facet-2F5L Cut-5XG) is a member of the Crystal Gems who made her debut in "Warp Tour". She was originally a Homeworld Gem technician and a certified Kindergartener. After being stranded on Earth following the events of "Jail Break", she acted as a recurring antagonist until becoming more of an anti-hero and pseudo-antagonist by establishing a truce with the Crystal Gems in "When It Rains" to help them save the Earth from the Cluster. She officially became a member in "Message Received" after she defied her Homeworld superior, Yellow Diamond. For some time, Peridot lived in the barn with Lapis Lazuli, but began residing in the Crystal Temple after Lapis fled the planet with their home in "Raising the Barn".
