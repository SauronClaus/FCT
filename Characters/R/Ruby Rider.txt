Ruby Rider
Band of Fools Original
Ruby Rider was a member of the original Band of Fools. A Fire Genasi Warlock of the Fiend, Ruby joined the Band after being erroneously summoned by Iarno Albrek during the party's first encounter at the Redcloak's Mansion. After that, he was a member of the band until after the second Death Knight fight, whereupon he revealed himself to be the warlock of a darker power before teleporting away to parts unknown.
