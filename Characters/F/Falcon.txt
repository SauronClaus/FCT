Sam Wilson
Marvel Comics
Falcon (Samuel Thomas "Sam" Wilson) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was introduced by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan in Captain America #117 (September 1969), and was the first African-American superhero in mainstream comic books. As the superhero Falcon, Wilson uses mechanical wings to fly, and has limited telepathic and empathic control over birds. Following Steve Rogers's retirement, Wilson becomes the newest Captain America in All-New Captain America #1 (January 2015) and leader of the Avengers. Wilson's deceased nephew was the Incredible Hulk's sometime-sidekick Jim Wilson, one of the first openly HIV-positive comic-book characters. Jim Wilson's father Gideon Wilson would go on to join the Gamma Corps.
