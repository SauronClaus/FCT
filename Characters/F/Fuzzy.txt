Fuzzy
Sam and Fuzzy
Fuzzy is Sam's roommate, a short bear-like creature, apparently some years over 20. Fuzzy was once a thief known as Eric, but he lost all of his memory as a result of an incident where his partners Hazel Kim and Brain wiped his memory for reasons currently unknown. After this, Hazel rechristened him "Fuzzy" and attempted to start their partnership fresh, but later chose to abandon him instead. After these events, Fuzzy met Sam and has lived with him ever since. Fuzzy is known for his ambition, ego, and propensity for seemingly random violence, although he seems to have mellowed somewhat recently. As a result, a business deal prior to his memory loss, involving Hazel, Brain and Sin, an army of robot clones of Fuzzy were created, including one that has been nicknamed Bonus and seems to have some of Fuzzy's missing memories. Fuzzy has recently become quite famous after starring in a television program called "Teddy Knows Best". Fuzzy then used his new fortune to fund the hostile takeover of the holdings of an Underground Committee member, leading to him gaining a seat on the Underground Committee.
