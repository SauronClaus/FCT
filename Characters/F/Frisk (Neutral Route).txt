Frisk
Undertale
Frisk is the playable character and main protagonist of Undertale. After Frisk falls into the Underground, they embark on a journey to return to the surface. Frisk is the last of the eight humans to fall into the Underground after traveling to Mount Ebott. Frisk is not the "fallen human" whom the player names at the beginning of the game, but Frisk's name is only revealed in the True Pacifist Route.
