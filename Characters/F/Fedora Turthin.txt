Fedora Turthin
Unbroken
Fedora Turthin was a female warforged fighter (Battlemaster) who joined with the party in 12065 after Reithen Keiros was recovering from magical substances. She accompanied the party to the secondary Phyrexian facility in an attempt to recover a misplaced artifact. Before that, she was a soldier in the great warforged empire several centuries prior before being deactivated and reactivated in 12047 by Eva Turthin, a gnommish artificer.
