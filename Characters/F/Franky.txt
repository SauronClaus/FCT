Franky
One Piece
"Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the crew's eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. Originally from the South Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters.
