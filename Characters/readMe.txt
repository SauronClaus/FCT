Alright, so how characters work: 
There's 22 lines, in this order. Thoses lines are: 

1. Name- Self explanatory- what the character goes by. Typically, this will also be the file name. 
2. Franchise- Self explanatory. What franchise the character belongs too. Try to be specific, like "Avatar: The Last Airbender" vs "Legends of Korra", and "Star Wars Prequel Trilogy" vs "Star Wars Original Trilogy".
3. Description- A short description of the character, often taken from a wiki or something.
4. Image- a thumbnail image of the character. 
5. First Name (if applicable). Some characters obviously don't have a first name (such as C3P0)- if so, leave this space blank.
6. Last Name (if applicable). Some characters obviously don't have a first name (such as R2-D2)- if so, leave this space blank.
7. Full Name/Title/Alias (if applicable); if multiple, separated by |. There can be a lot of these, so just use the more common ones. Use discretion, and don't feel an urge to put every nickname in. I recommend the common ones though, along with the name in line #1.
8. Actor(s)- Actors are for all the renditions, separated by |. Sometimes there aren't any voice actors- that's fine. Mostly grab the major ones, feel free to skip a few if there's a ton like Batman or something.
9. Age (in years|decades)- In universe. If a character hasn't yet lived a decade, just put that number as 0. If there's a sliding timescale/no official age, just either give a guess or leave it blank.
10. Type (bit arbitrary but like Wizard/Sorcerer/etc.)- Self explanatory. Quite arbitrary. I'll consolidate these at the end, so just do your best.
11. Race (Mainly human, but also like robots and stuff)- Self explanatory, again. Once again, I'll consoldiate these. Try to be somewhat specific (so like "Mutant" or "Kryptonian").
12. Alignment (Good/Evil/Neutral/Depends)- Subjective, once again. THIS IS NOT D&D ALIGNMENT- no Lawful Good, just "Good". Also, use the most common version of the character- not some niche, "What if the Joker was good" type thing.
13. Role (Protagonist/Supporting Character/Antagonist, etc.)- Again, a bit biased. Use some discretion here, I'll consolidate them later. The main tags I've used are "Protagonist", "Antagonist", "Supporting Protagonist", "NPC", and "Playable Character".
14. Gender!- If the character's gender depends on player choices, put "Depends". Otherwise male, female, neither, all of those work. 
15. Tags- These are the important ones. Put some tags for traits the character might have that other characters may share- personality, history, etc. The important tag is Medium (like TV Shows, Video Games, etc.). Other then that, also add any groups they're associated with (such as "Jedi" or "Phantom Thieves") and any signature weapons they may have (like "Archer"). 
16. Power Level! (Baseline, Modified Human, City, Country, World, Cosmic, Interuniversal, Omnipotent)- This one's, once again, quite subjective. What's the biggest amount of property they could destroy before someone stopped them? What kind of blow can they take? Just guess, and someone may fact-check you later!
17. Popularity (Low, Medium, High)- Be fair here. "Low" is some niche character from a YA novel or a side character, "Medium" is someone somewhat known (maybe the name has been heard, if not the properties), and "High" is someone extremely well-known, like "Aang" from ATLA or something.
18. Groups- What groups is this character in? Make up names if they're unofficial, but who does this character associate with?
19. Theme Song- self-explanatory. If they have multiple, use "|" to seperate them. 
20. Medium- Originally a tag. Stuff like Cartoon, Video Games, TV Shows, etc. Seperate with ",". 
21. Brand- Kind of the umbrella for the new franchise. The Franchise may be "Prequel Trilogy Star Wars", with the brand being "Star Wars". Or "Avengers" and "Marvel".
22. Signature Weapon- Thor's got Mjolnir, Edelgard's got Aymr, and Thanos has his Infinity Gauntlet. Any items in here should correspond with an Artifact in artifacts. 

Alright so other important notes: 
- If you can't find the info on somebody, no worries, just leave the line blank. I can spin around later and check it out if need be.
- If adding someone, no commas, line breaks, or "|" in their names. 
- Be fair when ranking someone- having a niche character nobody's ever heard of multiple days in a row is no fun for anyone.
- Submit merge requests and I'll try to figure out how that works? We'll see. Never collabed with people over GitHub before. 
- Big note: everything is seperated with "|", except for tags, which are seperated with ",". If the tag has an extra character attached, the tag name and character name is seperated with a "|".
- That's it! Thanks so much for your help with this project!
