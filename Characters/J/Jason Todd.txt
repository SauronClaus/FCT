Jason Todd
DC Comics
Jason Peter Todd is a fictional antihero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman. He is the second character to assume the role of Robin and the second and best-known character to take up the Red Hood alias. First appearing in Batman #357 (March 1983), Todd was created to succeed Dick Grayson, the original Robin, as Batman's vigilante partner. Initially sharing a similar origin to Grayson, subsequent portrayals commonly depict Todd as an orphaned street delinquent who displays extremely violent behaviour, whom Batman attempts to reform and mentor.
