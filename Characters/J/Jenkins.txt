Jenkins
Atomic Robo
Jenkins was a member of the Action Scientists, who first met Robo when the latter rescued him from the vampire dimension. His almost super-human combat competence was a running gag in the series, and Robo has been jokingly referred to as his sidekick. Jenkins was formerly part of Majestic 12, a government paramilitary organization dedicated to the collection and use of advanced technologies which opposes Tesladyne.
