Jason Grace
Percy Jackson
Jason Grace was a Roman demigod, the son of Jupiter and the mortal Beryl Grace and the younger brother of Thalia Grace. Jason was a praetor of the Twelfth Legion at Camp Jupiter until he gave his rank to Frank Zhang during The House of Hades as a field promotion; he was the former head counselor of Cabin One at Camp Half-Blood and the Pontifex Maximus at Camp Jupiter. He was in a relationship with Piper McLean until she broke up with him because their relationship felt "forced" and was largely orchestrated by the marriage goddess, Hera. A couple of months later, he died at the hands of the third emperor, Caligula, when fighting aboard his yachts. Nico di Angelo subsequently has a feeling that Jason is somewhere better, although he isn't sure if Jason is in Elysium or if he chose rebirth. He is also one of the seven Heroes of Olympus.
