Professor Moriarty
Sherlock Holmes
Professor James Moriarty is a fictional character that first appeared in the Sherlock Holmes short story The Final Problem written by Arthur Conan Doyle and published under the second collection of Holmes short stories, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes late in 1893. Moriarty was also featured in the fourth and final Sherlock Holmes novel The Valley of Fear but never made direct appearance in the story. Apart from that Holmes mentions him in five other stories namely, The Adventure of the Empty House, The Adventure of the Norwood Builder, The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter, The Adventure of the Illustrious Client, His Last Bow. The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes. Although many adaptations and pastiches give him the first name of James, the first Doyle story to feature him ("The Final Problem") does not give him a first name, whereas the short story "The Adventure of the Empty House" said his first name is James (previously said to be the name of his brother).
