Jinbe
One Piece
"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc. Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford.
