Ember Celica
RWBY
Ember Celica are Yang Xiao Long's signature weapons. They are a pair of Dual Ranged Shot Gauntlets (DRSG) which she is first seen wielding in the "Yellow" Trailer. After Yang lost her right arm, she received a robotic one with a shotgun installed to make up for the lost gauntlet. It was later upgraded in Volume 7, once Yang arrived in Atlas.
