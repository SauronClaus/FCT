Annabeth's Knife
Percy Jackson
Annabeth's Knife was Annabeth Chase's primary weapon, and she was very skilled in using it. She used it very frequently, as it was a gift from Luke Castellan (who got it from Halcyon Green, who got it from a young girl) when she was seven. This knife is made out of celestial bronze which makes it a weapon for monster killing.
