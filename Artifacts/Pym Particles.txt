Pym Particles
Marvel Comics
Dr. Henry Pym originally discovered and isolated a rare group of subatomic particles, which have become known as the "Pym Particles", which could alter the size and mass of objects or living beings. The Pym Particles allowed the user to bypass the Square-cube law of physics.
