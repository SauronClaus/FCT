Leviathan Axe
God of War
The Leviathan Axe is a two-handed war axe that is Kratos' main offensive weapon in God of War. It was forged by the Huldra Brothers, Sindri and Brok, who also forged Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, after feeling responsible for the destruction brought about by Thor. As a weapon made to oppose the power of Mjölnir and inspired by the epic size of Jörmungandr, Brok suggests the axe be named Leviathan. According to Sindri when first meeting him, the blade was infused with the echoing screams of twenty frost trolls (give or take) and it was made for and given to Laufey who passed it on to her husband Kratos, before her death.
