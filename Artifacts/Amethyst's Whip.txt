Amethyst's Whip
Steven Universe
Amethyst bears a multi-tailed dark violet whip able to take on one, two, or three tails depending on the task at hand. It has a cross-guard in the form of a lavender star. The lash is dark purple and is divided into three different segments with spiked balls on the ends. Multiple amethyst shards are embedded on the main lash which inflicts additional damage and further restrains the target. Her whip has a purple amethyst as the pommel and the handle itself is purplish gray. She is seen using her one-tailed whip for smaller tasks, her two-tailed whip for regular combat, and her three-tailed whip for larger tasks and dual-wielding.
