Garnet's Gauntlets
Steven Universe
Garnet usually dual-wields weapons on both hands and they are the only weapons to regenerate with different designs. Her gauntlets cover half her lower arms at normal size and her whole lower arms when she increases their size. Before regenerating, her gauntlets have red and light-red spirals around the entire shafts, red and dark red fingers, and contain the same star motif on the tops and bases of the gauntlets.
