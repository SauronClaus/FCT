The Tanden Engine
Street Fighter
The Tanden Engine is a large spherical device developed by Shadaloo intended to be implanted in the user's stomach area. The Engine can act as a miniature black hole to suck in and expel people and objects as well as allowing the wielder to harness ki energy and copy the abilities of those they defeat.
