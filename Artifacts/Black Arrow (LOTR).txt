The Black Arrow
The Hobbit
The Black Arrow was Bard the Bowman's last remaining arrow when Smaug attacked Lake-town and, directed by a Thrush who had overheard a conversation between Bilbo Baggins and Smaug, he shot it with remarkable speed into the dragon's only weak spot; a small chink in the scales upon its left chest. Smaug was felled by the shot, and the Lonely Mountain, Dale, and Lake-town were freed.
