Barret's Gatling Gun-Arm (Final Fantasy VII)
Final Fantasy VII
The Gatling Gun is Barret's default weapon in Final Fantasy VII Remake. It is a ranged weapon that teaches Barret the Focused Shot, consuming Barret's ATB charges to deal burst damage to an enemy. As a default weapon, Gatling Gun has mixed and well-rounded attributes, though it does not excel in any area specifically.
