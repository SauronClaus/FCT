Gordon Freeman's Crowbar
Half-Life
The Crowbar is an iconic melee weapon and the signature weapon of Gordon Freeman. It is the first weapon acquired in Half-Life, serving as a signature melee weapon and a tool for puzzles. The crowbar is also used as a tool for breaking open supply crates and clearing destructible obstacles. The main melee weapon in the Half-Life story arc and the only melee weapon in the Half-Life 2 story arc, it is widely considered the iconic weapon of the Half-Life series, perhaps almost as famous as Gordon Freeman himself when referring to Half-Life.
