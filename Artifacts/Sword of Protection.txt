Sword of Protection
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power
The Sword of Protection is entrusted to the current incarnation and keeper of She-Ra's power, allowing her to transform into She-Ra at will. It channeled the magic of Etheria to She-Ra. It is a major weapon that appears in nearly every episode, until it was shattered by Adora. In season five, Adora was shown to have been able to transform into She-Ra without the sword, the sword materializing and disappearing as she transformed back and forth into and out of She-Ra.
