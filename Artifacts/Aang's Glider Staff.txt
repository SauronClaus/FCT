Aang's Glider Staff
Avatar: The Last Airbender
An airbender staff is a wooden stave used primarily by airbenders to augment their bending. These versatile instruments were a major part of Air Nomad culture and used in the execution of several complex airbending techniques. Staffs were constructed to unfold into fan-like gliders, which enabled airbenders to fly while manipulating the air currents around them.
