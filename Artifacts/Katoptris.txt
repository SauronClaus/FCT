Katoptris
Percy Jackson
Katoptris (meaning "looking glass" or "mirror" in Ancient Greek) is a dagger that once belonged to Helen of Troy, fitting accurately for its name as Helen only used it as a mirror. However, in The Lost Hero, it became Piper McLean's dagger after she selects it to be her own, and she uses it for battle as well as seeing visions of the future in it.
