Machine Pistol
Overwatch
Machine Pistol: Sombra's primary weapon. Her Machine Pistol shoots in a very fast fire-rate and has a large magazine. It has a large spread and deals little damage per shot. The gun works best in short-range combat, as it has damage falloff around mid-range. While the Machine Pistol is lacking in accuracy at range, it makes up for that in magazine size and fire rate. Sombra can unload onto close-range targets and dispatch them with ease, especially when aiming for headshots.
