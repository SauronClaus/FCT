Rose's Shield
Steven Universe
Steven wields his mother's spiraled pink shield. The spiral is decorated with light pink thorns and its center symbol is shaped like a rose. When struck it appears to generate a sound wave that negates Gem magic, as it disrupts Lapis Lazuli's water clones in "Ocean Gem" and Pearl's holograms in "Sworn to the Sword". He is capable of summoning it in larger sizes and repeatedly in a short space of time; however, as he is still a novice compared to the other Crystal Gems this can take a noticeable toll on him.
