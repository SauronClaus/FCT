Dragon Gem
Raya and the Last Dragon
The Dragon Gem is a gemstone featured in Disney's 2021 animated feature film Raya and the Last Dragon which was created from the essence of dragon magic by Pengu, Pranee, Jagan and Amba with the ability to banish evil entities and revive anyone who gets turned to stone. When it was first created and used for the first time against the Druun by Sisu, it revived everyone except the dragons. At some point, it came into the possession of Kumandra's Heart tribe who protected it within a secret chamber. Raya was trained to be a guardian of the gem by her father, Chief Benja who wants to make Kumandra whole again. After the other tribes tried to take the gem for themselves but end up breaking it, however, the Druun returned and each one of Kumandra's five tribes took a shard of the Dragon Gem as they make their escape. Raya uses her shard to protect herself from the Druun, and to summon Sisu back into the world.
