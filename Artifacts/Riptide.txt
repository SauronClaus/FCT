Riptide
Percy Jackson
Anaklusmos (Greek for Riptide) is the prized sword of Percy Jackson that is made of Celestial Bronze, a material that is only deadly to gods, demigods, Titans, Giants, and monsters. It does not affect mortals, as it just passes through them harmlessly. The sword is a medium length xiphos (a Greek one-handed double edged sword).
