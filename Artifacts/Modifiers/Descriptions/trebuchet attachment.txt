trebuchet attachment
The artifact has a trebuchet attached. This trebuchet fires full-size projectiles, but weighs little so the artifact can also be used for it's original purpose. A trebuchet (French: tr√©buchet) is a type of catapult that uses a long arm to throw a projectile. It was a common powerful siege engine until the advent of gunpowder. The design of a trebuchet allows it to launch projectiles of greater weights further distances than that of a traditional catapult.
