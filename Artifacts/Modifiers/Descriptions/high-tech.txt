high-tech
High technology (high tech), also known as frontier technology (frontier tech), is technology that is at the cutting edge: the most advanced technology available. It can be defined as either the most complex or the newest technology on the market. The opposite of high tech is low technology, referring to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology; for example, a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device. When high tech becomes old, it becomes low tech, for example vacuum tube electronics.
