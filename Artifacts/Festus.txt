Festus
Percy Jackson
Festus (meaning "happy" in Latin) is an automaton dragon created by the old Hephaestus cabin. With the blessing of their father, they made him many years before the series began to defend Camp Half-Blood, but Festus went haywire after Beckendorf's death as Beckendorf was Festus's caretaker. He was eventually destroyed but acted as the Argo II's masthead. Festus was later rebuilt by Leo Valdez in secret to play a major role in the defeat of Gaea and continues to serve Leo afterwards.
