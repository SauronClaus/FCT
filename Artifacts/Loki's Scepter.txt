Loki's Scepter
MCU
The Scepter, occasionally referred to as Loki's Scepter, was a staff weapon that served as the original containment vessel for the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones. Gifted by Thanos, the staff was wielded by Loki to lead and command the Chitauri Invasion to Earth. After the Battle of New York, the Scepter was confiscated by HYDRA, whose scientists used it to give extraordinary powers to the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Following HYDRA's defeat, the Scepter was retrieved by the Avengers who took it to Avengers Tower where Tony Stark experimented on it to complete the Ultron Program. The Scepter was taken and dismantled by Ultron after shattering its blue gem casing, which in the process revealed the Mind Stone inside.
