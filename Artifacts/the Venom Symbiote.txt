the Venom Symbiote
Marvel Comics
The symbiote that would be later known as the Venom Symbiote was created by the dark elder god Knull on Gorr's Homeworld. After Knull was overthrown by his own creations, most of the symbiotes memories would be erased, modified or altered, as Venom itself believed to be part of the 998th generation of a lineage of symbiotes born on the planet Klyntar and hatched of a clutch of eggs in a cavern.
