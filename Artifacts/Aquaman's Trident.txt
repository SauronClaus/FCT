The Trident of Neptune may be used by his chosen champions, and was most recently wielded by Aquaman. The Trident beholds a vast number of magical powers such as the power to command the sea (making tidal waves or whirlpools or even making columns of water to stand on), control the weather (summoning rain or storms or creating rainbows), unleash blasts of lightning, and even turn living creatures into something else.
