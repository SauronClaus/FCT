Pearl's Spear
Steven Universe
Pearl wields a spear comprised of a glowing blade with a white grip and a cyan, gold, and white pommel shaped like a star. The head of the blade spirals down the upper shaft becoming less sharp on the lower shaft. The spear changes lengths. In its regular spear form, it is roughly as tall as Garnet, while in its wand form, it is only as long as one of her swords.
