Arrow of Dodona
Trials of Apollo
The Arrow of Dodona is an arrow that Apollo found in the Grove of Dodona. The arrow has an oak shaft and green fletching. The Arrow speaks to Apollo in an Elizabethan accent and gives answers to Apollo. The answers are not prophetic, though they vary from how to make a plague arrow to giving driving directions to the Cave of Trophonius.
