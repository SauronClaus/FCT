Medi Gun
Team Fortress 2
The Medi Gun is the default secondary weapon for the Medic. It is a modified team-colored fire hose nozzle wrapped in black tape and outfitted with a bottom handle, which is connected to the Medic's backpack by a hose. It fires a glowing team-colored beam into the recipient, who will then emit similarly colored cross symbols, similar to a Teleporter trail. When a disguised Spy is over-healed, enemies can also see the team-colored crosses.
