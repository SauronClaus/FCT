When choosing an artifact, try to pick something interesting. It should be something clearly tied to a specific wielder (for example, "a Glock" would fall under HDM's weapon system. "Obi-Wan Kenobi's Lightsaber" falls under here.) and it should be a fun weapon ("Aquaman's pet goldfish" is just boring.)

Alright, so how artifact files work: 
There's 16 lines, in this order. Thoses lines are: 

1) Name- Self explanatory- what the artifact goes by. Typically, this will also be the file name. 
2) Franchise- Self explanatory. What franchise the artifact belongs too. Sometimes general, like "Star Wars" or "MCU", sometimes more specific, like "Avatar: The Last Airbender" vs "Legends of Korra". Use your discretion, but try to stay consistent.
3) Description- Describe the artifact!
4) Image- add an image URL for the artifact.
5) Link- Add an article where you can read more on the character.
6) Brand- What's the overarching brand?
7) Wielder- who classically wields the weapon? For Mjolnir, lots of characters have picked it up, but the main wielder is Thor. List all the classic wielders here, seperated by "|"
8) Tags- These are the important ones. Put some tags for traits the artifact might have that other artifact may share- sentient, history, wielder, etc. The important tag is Medium (like TV Shows, Video Games, etc.). Other then that, also add any groups they're associated with (such as "Jedi" or "Phantom Thieves"). 
9) Medium- What is this classically appearing in? Seperate with ",". 
10) Type- This ones another doozy. Put the type of artifact- weapon, vehicle, armor, etc.- and then the subtype (seperate type/subtype with "|"): Axe, Bow, Submarine, etc.
11) Sets- Add any sets this artifact belongs to, like the infinity stones. Seperate with "|".
12) Power Level! (Mundane, Slightly-Magical, City, Country, World, Cosmic, Interuniversal, Omnipotent)- This one's, once again, quite subjective. What's the biggest amount of property they could destroy before someone stopped them? Just guess, and someone may fact-check you later!
13) Popularity (Low, Medium, High)- Be fair here. "Low" is some niche weapon from a YA novel or a TV Show, "Medium" is something somewhat known (maybe the name has been heard, if not the properties), and "High" is something extremely well-known, like "Mjolnir" or something.
14) Color- add a color to colors.py, and write the name here! Or use an existing color!
15) Contributor- name the people making this file!
16) Any special restrictions?

Alright so other important notes: 
- If adding something, no commas, line breaks, or "|" in their names. 
- Be fair when ranking something- having a niche weapon nobody's ever heard of multiple days in a row is no fun for anyone.
- Submit merge requests and I'll try to figure out how that works? We'll see. Never collabed with people over GitHub before. 
- Big note: everything is seperated with "|", except for tags, which are seperated with ",". If the tag has an extra character attached, the tag name and character name is seperated with a "|".
- That's it! Thanks so much for your help with this project!
