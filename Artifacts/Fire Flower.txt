Fire Flower
Mario
Fire Flowers, also known as Flame Flowers, are a power-up that are obtainable in many games in the Mario franchise, originating from Super Mario Bros. They can be found inside blocks (mostly ? Blocks) that normally contain Super Mushrooms if the player is already in their Super form (or in later games any other powered-up form), and obtaining one transforms the player into their Fire form, allowing them to throw fireballs. The Ice Flower is the polar opposite of the Fire Flower.
