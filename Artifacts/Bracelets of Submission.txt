Bracelets of Submission
DC Comics
The Bracelets of Submission, also known as the Bracelets of Victory, are a pair of indestructible metal cuffs worn by all Amazons of Paradise Island. They symbolize the years when the Amazons were subjugated under the rule of the treacherous Hercules. After gaining their independence, the Amazons continued to wear the bracelets as a reminder of their past oppression. Wonder Woman has always worn a pair of these metal cuffs, but the design and model has varied over the years. She uses the bracelets as her primary method of defense, deflecting gunfire, blasts, small missiles and other projectile weaponry.
