Wand (Harry Potter)
Harry Potter
A wand was a quasi-sentient magical instrument through which a witch or wizard channelled their magical powers to centralise the effects for more complex results. Most spells were cast with the aid of wands, but spells could be cast without the use of wands. Although wandless magic was more common in other countries, such as some in Africa, European wizards were generally used to using the tool and found wandless magic more difficult, requiring much more concentration and skill to perform these spells.
