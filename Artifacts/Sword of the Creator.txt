Sword of the Creator
Fire Emblem: Three Houses
The Sword of the Creator, also known as Creator Sword in Fire Emblem Heroes, is a sword that originated in Fire Emblem: Three Houses. The Sword of the Creator is a Hero's Relic of exceptional power and is said to be a gift to humanity by the Goddess herself. It requires the Crest of Flames in order to wield it. Its only wielder in history was Nemesis until his defeat by the heroine Seiros. Without any known descendants, it is widely believed that the sword no longer has a compatible wielder as he was the sole known individual to bear the Crest of Flames.
