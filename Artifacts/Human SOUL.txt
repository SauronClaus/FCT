Human SOUL
Undertale
The SOUL is the very essence of one's being, whether one is human or monster. It plays a crucial role in the progression and plot of Undertale. In the game, a human SOUL and monster SOUL together can cross the Barrier, while seven human SOULs shatter it entirely. A SOUL takes on the form of a heart. Human SOULs point down in most cases, and monster SOULs point up.
