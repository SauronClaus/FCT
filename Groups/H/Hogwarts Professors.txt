Hogwarts Professors
Harry Potter
The title of Professor was given to members of the wizarding scientific and scholarly community engaged in education and research, taken as a whole. It was, perhaps most notably, used by teachers at wizarding educational institutions such as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Durmstrang Institute.
