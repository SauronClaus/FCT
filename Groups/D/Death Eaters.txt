Death Eaters
Harry Potter
The Death Eaters were the most ardent followers of Lord Voldemort. The group primarily consisted of wizards and witches who were radical pure-blood supremacists who practised the Dark Arts with reckless abandon, malevolence and without regard to or fear of wizarding law, although some of them joined him out of fear or were blackmailed to do so.
