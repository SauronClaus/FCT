501st Legion (Star Wars)
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
The 501st Legion, also known as the 501st or 501st Battalion and later as "Vader's Fist", was a brigade-sized legion of elite clone troopers who fought under the Galactic Republic through its transition into the Galactic Empire. The Legion was secretly commissioned by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who later deployed it to fight in the Clone Wars with the Senate's permission. Since its action at the First Battle of Geonosis, it gained a reputation as an effective fighting force, often achieving victory against overwhelming odds.
