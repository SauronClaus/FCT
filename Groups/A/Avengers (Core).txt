Avengers (Core)
Marvel Comics
The core members of the Avengers- the members that tend to be members over multiple mediums. The Avengers have been assembled by fate as a group of extraordinary champions with diverse abilities. As "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", their purpose is to protect and safeguard the world from both domestic and extraterrestrial threats. Finding strength in union, they uphold their tradition to overcome menaces a single individual could not withstand. The Avengers usually count with official recognition and clearance as a peacekeeping initiative that fights for liberty and justice, being funded chiefly by Tony Stark and inspired by Steve Rogers. More recently, the Avengers have become deeply influenced by the legacy of the ancient history of Earth's superpowered beings, combating different simultaneous threats on global, universal and multiversal scale.
