Asgardians
Marvel Comics
The Asgardians are a humanoid race of extradimensional beings that hail from Asgard, a small pocket-dimension adjacent to Earth. They travel around the Nine Realms including Earth via an interdimensional nexus known as the Bifrost. They are also known as the Aesir Gods who have been worshiped by the humans of Scandinavia, Britain, and Northern Europe. The religion however fell out of favor due to the rise of Christianity.
