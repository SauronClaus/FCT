Floor 19
Magnus Chase
The Nineteenth Floor of Hotel Valhalla is the floor where Magnus Chase and his friends reside. The vaulted ceiling is twenty feet tall, lined with spears for rafters. Torches burn in iron sconces on the walls, casting warm orange light onto the wall display of swords, shields and tapestries. The floor is laid with blood-red carpet that has tree-branch designs that move. Each room door is made from rough-hewn oak bound in iron, and set about fifty feet apart. There are no doorknobs or locks, as the rooms are personal afterlives which can be accessed with a dagaz rune. Each room has an iron nameplate the size of a plate, with a name surrounded by a ring of runes. Once the dagaz rune is used on a room door, the ring of runes glows green.
