Fellowship of the Ring
Lord of the Rings
The Fellowship of the Ring was formed as a brotherhood among members of the various Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Its purpose was to take the One Ring to Mordor so that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom, the mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed and ultimately eradicate the Dark Lord Sauron.
