First Order (Star Wars)
Star Wars Sequel Trilogy
The First Order, or simply the Order, was a fascist military junta in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy that espoused a radical neo-Imperialist ideology during the era of the New Republic. The First Order was ruled by a Supreme Leader from their mobile headquarters instead of a traditional planetary capital. The First Order was isolationist for much of it history and had a fanatical devotion to the totalitarian notions of order and a violent disdain for democracy, seeking to be a more refined and pure version of what the Galactic Empire sought to become, and viewed itself as not a continuation of it, but its successor. The First Order had began to subvert the New Republic and became locked in a Cold War with it, resulting in the First Order invading and annexing vast regions of the galaxy, but military rule was met with defiance and rebellion. The First Order would join the revived Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious in his bid to bring about a new age of the Sith, only to be prevented by the Resistance, causing their grip to crumble.
