Guardians of the Galaxy (Core)
Marvel Comics
The core members of the Guardians of the Galaxy- the members that tend to be members over multiple mediums. The Guardians of the Galaxy have been idealized by Peter Quill, the legendary Star-Lord, as a pro-active team to protect the cosmos. Quill idealized the team in light of two subsequent crisis that had forced independent heroes to improvise a resistance when the galaxy was threatened, namely the incursion of the Annihilation Wave and the conquest of the Kree Empire by the Phalanx. The Guardians of the Galaxy usually transit between being a sanctioned police force in space or a group of outlawed mercenaries. By expecting no one else would do their heroic work, their goal is to protect innocent civilizations from being destroyed or enslaved by opportunistic invaders.
