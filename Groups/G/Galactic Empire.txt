Galactic Empire
Star Wars Original Trilogy
The Galactic Empire, declared as the First Galactic Empire and remembered as the Old Empire, was the immense galaxy spaning empire, ruling with an iron fist, oppressing and enslaving courtless species in the form of a fascist dictatorship ruled in secret by the Sith, an ancient religious order of Force-wielders devoted to the dark side of the Force, having replaced the Galactic Republic, a galaxy-wide democracy of sovereign star systems at the end of the Clone Wars by Darth Sidious, known publicly as Emperor Palpatine, whose reign from Coruscant was enforced by Darth Vader. The subsequent Imperial Era would last only two decades, when the Alliance to Restore the Republic opposed the New Order, and was able to create the New Republic which succeeded in the Empire downfall.
