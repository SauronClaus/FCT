Greek Demigods (Rick Riordan)
Percy Jackson
Greek demigods, such as Percy Jackson, are a subset of demigods who train at Camp Half-Blood, located in Long Island. They are born when a god conceives a child with a mortal while in their Greek aspect. As such, Greek demigods have an innate predisposition towards Ancient Greek and possess instinctive battle skills which manifests as dyslexia and ADHD respectively. Egyptian magic doesn't harm them as seen in Demigods & Magicians.
