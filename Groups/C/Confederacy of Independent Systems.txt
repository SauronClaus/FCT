Confederacy of Independent Systems
Star Wars Prequel Trilogy
The Confederacy of Independent Systems, abbreviated to CIS, and otherwise known as the Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the Separatist Confederacy, or simply referred to as the Separatists, was a confederate alliance formed from thousands of sovereign star systems of the Inner Rim, Mid Rim and Outer Rim Territories which had withdraw as member-worlds from the Galactic Republic, whom the Confederacy had opposed from 24 BBY until 19 BBY following a period of political turmoil. Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as the government's Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the government was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's legislative council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.
