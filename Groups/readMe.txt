And, as always, other important notes: 
- If you can't find the info on somebody, no worries, just leave the line blank. I can spin around later and check it out if need be. It's very important that the line exists though- screws up the code if it doesn't.
- If adding someone, no commas, line breaks, or "|" in their file names, and try to keep other stuff clear of those unless needed. 
- Be fair when ranking someone- having a niche character nobody's ever heard of multiple days in a row is no fun for anyone.
- Submit merge requests and I'll try to figure out how that works? We'll see. Never collabed with people over GitHub before. 
- Big note: everything is seperated with "|", except for tags, groups, and a few other things, which are seperated with ",". If the tag has an extra character attached, the tag name and character name is seperated with a "|".
- That's it! Thanks so much for your help with this project!
