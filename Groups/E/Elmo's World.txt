Elmo's World
Sesame Street
Elmo's World is a segment that is shown at the end of the American children's television program Sesame Street. It premiered on November 16, 1998, as part of the show's structural change and originally lasted fifteen minutes at the end of each episode until 2009. However it came back in 2017. The show was designed to appeal to younger viewers and to increase ratings, which had fallen in the past decade. The segment is presented from the perspective of a three-year-old child as represented by its host, the Muppet Elmo, performed by Kevin Clash in the original series and Ryan Dillon in the 2017 reboot.
