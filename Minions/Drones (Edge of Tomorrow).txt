Mimics (Drones)
Edge of Tomorrow
The Mimics are a species of aliens from the 2014 film Edge of Tomorrow in which they serve as the main antagonists. Mimics are a hostile alien species that invaded Earth. They are named after their ability to quickly adapt to any environment or combat tactics, they pose a huge threat to the human race. Mimics are incredibly agile and strong, being able to quickly kill multiple soldiers on their own. Mimics come in three variants - Drones, Alphas and The Omega. The species not only share one mind, but also have developed the ability to turn back time, letting them continuously retry different battle strategies until the Mimics win. This ability can be transferred through blood to humans. While their reason to coming to Earth is never revealed; it's speculated that the Mimics are after Earth's natural resources.
