Stormtroopers
Star Wars Original Trilogy
Stormtroopers (ST)—known as TK stormtroopers and as TK troopers during the early Imperial Era, Remnant Stormtroopers after the Battle of Endor, and colloquially referred to as "bucketheads"—were the infantry soldiers of the Galactic Empire. The members of the Imperial Army's Stormtrooper Corps served on the frontline as elite shock troops, and their loyalty to the Empire was absolute as a result of their training. The stormtrooper armor that they wore consisted of white plastoid plates over a black body glove, and their standard weapon was the E-11 blaster rifle. In addition to the standard trooper, various specialized units such as scout troopers and snowtroopers comprised the ranks of the Stormtrooper Corps.
