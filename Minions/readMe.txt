Alright, so how minions work: 
There's 24 lines, in this order. Thoses lines are: 

1. Name- Self explanatory- what the minions go by. Typically, this will also be the file name. 
2. Franchise- Self explanatory. What franchise the minions belong too. Try to be specific, like "Avatar: The Last Airbender" vs "Legends of Korra", and "Star Wars Prequel Trilogy" vs "Star Wars Original Trilogy".
3. Description- A short description of the minions, often taken from a wiki or something.
4. Image- a thumbnail image of the minions. 
5. Add an article where you can find more information on the minions.
6. Commanders- Who commands this minion horde? List all the associated characters, seperate with "|".
7. Connected Groups- who else is a subset of this minion horde, or allied with them?
8. Quantity (if measurable)- seperated by (number|100's)
9. Actor(s)- Actors are for all the renditions, separated by |. Sometimes there aren't any voice actors- that's fine.
10. Type (bit arbitrary but like Horde/Army/etc.)- Self explanatory. Quite arbitrary. I'll consolidate these at the end, so just do your best.
11. Race (Mainly human, but also like robots and stuff)- Self explanatory, again. Once again, I'll consoldiate these. Try to be somewhat specific (so like "Rat Creature" or "Human").
12. Alignment (Good/Evil/Neutral/Depends)- Subjective, once again. THIS IS NOT D&D ALIGNMENT- no Lawful Good, just "Good". Also, use the most common version of the minions- not some niche, "What if the Galactic Empire was good" type thing.
13. Tags- These are the important ones. Put some tags for traits the minions might have that other minions may share- personality, history, etc. Other then that, also add any groups they're associated with (such as "Jedi" or "Phantom Thieves") and any signature weapons they may have (like "Archer"). 
14. Power Level! (Baseline, Modified Human, City, Country, World, Cosmic, Interuniversal, Omnipotent)- This one's, once again, quite subjective. What's the biggest amount of property they could destroy before someone stopped them? What kind of blow can they take? Just guess, and someone may fact-check you later!
15. Popularity (Low, Medium, High)- Be fair here. "Low" is some niche character from a YA novel or a side character, "Medium" is someone somewhat known (maybe the name has been heard, if not the properties), and "High" is someone extremely well-known, like "Aang" from ATLA or something.
16. Theme Song- self-explanatory. Make it "song title|Song Spotify Link". If they have multiple, use "," to seperate them. 
17. Medium- Originally a tag. Stuff like Cartoon, Video Games, TV Shows, etc. Seperate with ",". 
18. Brand- Kind of the umbrella for the new franchise. The Franchise may be "Prequel Trilogy Star Wars", with the brand being "Star Wars". Or "Avengers" and "Marvel".
19. Color- use a name, and then add the color to colors.py as an entry in the dictionary.
20. Powers- along with the subset and tier of power (tiers going, in order, 1: Baseline (almost useless), 2: Slightly useful, 3: Small town destroying, 4: City destroying, 5: country tackling, 6: hemisphere destroying, 7: world destroying, 8: multi-world destruction, 9: inter-universal destruction, 10: Omniscience)
21. Brand- what's the parent company? (Disney, 20th Century Fox, etc.)
22. Contributors- the names of the people contributing to this particular file.
23. Variants- variants of the minion (Snowtrooper, Fire Nation Fire Benders, etc.) These should mostly be cosmetic- any variants that add changes to the tags will be handled later.
24. Special Character? Just add a No here, we'll fix that up later. 

Alright so other important notes: 
- If you can't find the info on some horde, no worries, just leave the line blank. I can spin around later and check it out if need be. It's very important that the line exists though- screws up the code if it doesn't.
- If adding some group, no commas, line breaks, or "|" in their names. 
- Be fair when ranking minions- having a niche minion group nobody's ever heard of multiple days in a row is no fun for anyone.
- Submit merge requests and I'll try to figure out how that works? We'll see. Never collabed with people over GitHub before. 
- Big note: everything is seperated with "|", except for tags, groups, contributors, and a few others, which are seperated with ",". If the tag has an extra character attached, the tag name and minion name is seperated with a "|".
- That's it! Thanks so much for your help with this project!
