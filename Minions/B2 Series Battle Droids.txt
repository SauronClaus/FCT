B2-series super battle droid
Star Wars Prequel Trilogy
B2-series super battle droids, also known as B2 super battle droids, super battle droids or super droids, were an advanced battle droid used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Although one model of the B2-series was only equipped with wrist blasters on their right forearm, another was outfitted with wrist blasters on both forearms. Super battle droids were much stronger than their predecessors, and like the updated B1s used by the Confederacy, they did not require a command system to operate, which gave the droids limited independence. Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies. As a result, they relied on organic commanders or tactical droids in order to effectively operate. The B2 was much stronger than the B1s, with enough strength to lift a clone trooper off the ground.
