B1-series battle droid
Star Wars Prequel Trilogy
B1-series battle droids, also referred to as B1 battle droids, standard battle droids, clankers, or tinnies were the most widely used battle droids manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop. Even though they were widely produced and deployed, the B1 battle droid was flimsily designed and easy to destroy, and was only truly successful in large numbers. Early versions of the model also required the use of a Central Control Computer, but despite these weaknesses they saw extensive service as the mainlines soldier of the Trade Federation's mechanized droid army. The droid army was deployed during the Invasion of Naboo, and after landing B1 battle droids marched into the Naboo capital of Theed, and using the massive army the Trade Federation captured the city. The droids continued to keep the Trade Federation's grip on the planet throughout the occupation, and the majority of Federation droid troops were deployed to combat the Gungan Grand Army at the Great Grass Plains. In the ensuing battle many militiagungs were killed, but the entire droid army was defeated because it shut down when the control computer was destroyed with the Federation's Droid Control Ship by the young Force-sensitive pilot, Anakin Skywalker during the portion of the battle that was in space.
