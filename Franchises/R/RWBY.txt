RWBY
RWBY (pronounced "Ruby") is an American anime-influenced adult computer-animated web series created by Monty Oum for Rooster Teeth. It is set in the fictional world of Remnant, where young people train to become warriors (called "Huntsmen" and "Huntresses") to protect their world from monsters called Grimm. The name RWBY is derived from the four main characters' forenames: Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang, and their respective theme colors (red, white, black and yellow).
