Alright, places! There's 17 lines involved here.

1. Name- Self explanatory- what the name of the story. Typically, this will also be the file name. 
2. Description- A short description of the franchise, often taken from a wiki or something.
3. Image- a thumbnail image URL of the franchise. 
4. Article- Add an article where you can find more information on the franchise.
5. Goals! These goals need to be accomplished for the story to be successful; mostly, they're the goals that the protagonists must complete to be successful.
6. Reach Goals! These goals are bonuses! If the character's don't accomplish them, oh well, but if they do, bonus points to them. 
7. Stretch Goals! These goals are the far out ones. Typically, if they're accomplished, the majority of the plot doesn't happen. 
8. The character inserts! These are splitted with a "|", and just tell the things which characters to replace.
9. Antagonist Inserts! These are splitted with a "|" as well.
10. Artifact! The MacGuffin. The "Thing" that everyone wants, be it the Infinity Gauntlet, Loki's Scepter, etc.
11. Theme Song- the theme for the franchise/story. Use the song name|song link from before.
12. Franchise- the franchise set. 
13. Brand- Overarching brand set for the francise.
14. Medium- What medium is the franchise in?
15. Color- The color for the franchise embed! Make it purtty. 
16. Popularity (Low, Medium, High)- Be fair here. "Low" is some niche story- a YA novel or some random TV Show, "Medium" is something somewhat known (maybe the name has been heard, if not the properties), and "High" is something extremely well-known, like "Star Wars" or something.
17. Power Level- What is the average power level of the characters in the franchise? Rough estimate.



Alright so other important notes: 
- If adding something, no commas, line breaks, or "|" in their names. 
- Be fair when ranking something- having a niche story nobody's ever heard of multiple days in a row is no fun for anyone.
- Submit merge requests and I'll try to figure out how that works? We'll see. Never collabed with people over GitHub before. 
- Big note: everything is seperated with "|", except for tags, which are seperated with ",". If the tag has an extra character attached, the tag name and character name is seperated with a "|".
- That's it! Thanks so much for your help with this project!
