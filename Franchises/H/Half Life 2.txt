Half-Life 2
Half-Life 2 is a 2004 first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve. Like the original Half-Life (1998), it combines shooting, puzzles, and storytelling, and adds features such as vehicles and physics-based gameplay. Set roughly twenty years after the first game, players control Gordon Freeman as he joins a resistance movement to liberate the Earth from the control of an alien empire called the Combine.
